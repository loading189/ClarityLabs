1️⃣ TIMING & LIQUIDITY SIGNALS (the most important)

These are existential signals.

1.1 Cash Runway Compression

What it measures
“How many days of recent outflows could current cash support?”

Data needed

Cash balance (bank)

Rolling average daily outflows

Why it matters
This is the cash equivalent of solvency.

Yellow

Runway shrinking >20% over 30–60 days

Red

Runway <30 days or shrinking rapidly week over week

1.2 Cash Timing Mismatch

What it measures
“Are outflows consistently hitting before inflows?”

Data needed

Timestamps of deposits vs payroll / rent / fixed expenses

Why it matters
This is how profitable businesses still die.

Yellow

Payroll frequently precedes deposits

Cash dips below prior lows on payroll days

Red

Repeated negative cash windows before deposits

Increasing reliance on timing luck

1.3 Deposit Delay Drift

What it measures
“Are deposits arriving later than they used to?”

Data needed

Sale timestamp vs deposit timestamp (Stripe, POS)

Why it matters
Deposit delays silently break cash planning.

Yellow

Average delay increasing vs baseline

Red

Long-tail delays appearing

Delays coincide with high outflow periods

2️⃣ REVENUE STABILITY SIGNALS

These detect top-line fragility, not just decline.

2.1 Revenue Velocity Deceleration

What it measures
“Is revenue growth slowing relative to its own trend?”

Data needed

Rolling revenue totals

Why it matters
Deceleration precedes decline.

Yellow

Growth rate flattening

Positive but slowing slope

Red

Sustained negative slope

2.2 Revenue Consistency Breakdown

What it measures
“How predictable are inflows?”

Data needed

Daily/weekly inflow variance

Why it matters
Unpredictable revenue is operational poison.

Yellow

Increasing variance without growth

Red

Few large days replacing many normal days

2.3 Refund / Reversal Escalation

What it measures
“Are refunds rising relative to sales?”

Data needed

Refund events

Gross sales events

Why it matters
Refunds are delayed revenue corrections.

Yellow

Refund rate trending upward

Red

Refund clustering

Refunds wiping out recent sales

3️⃣ COST & MARGIN SIGNALS

These detect slow erosion, not sudden collapse.

3.1 Expense Creep

What it measures
“Are expenses rising faster than revenue?”

Data needed

Expense totals

Revenue totals

Why it matters
This kills businesses quietly.

Yellow

Expense/revenue ratio trending up

Red

Expenses rising while revenue flat/down

3.2 Payroll Load Stress

What it measures
“How heavy payroll is relative to inflows.”

Data needed

Payroll runs

Revenue deposits

Why it matters
Payroll is the least flexible cost.

Yellow

Payroll share creeping upward

Red

Payroll dominates outflows during slow periods

3.3 Fee Leakage

What it measures
“How much value leaks to processors/platforms.”

Data needed

Fee transactions

Gross inflows

Why it matters
Fees are invisible margin killers.

Yellow

Fee % rising slowly

Red

Fee spikes during revenue softness

4️⃣ VOLATILITY & PREDICTABILITY SIGNALS

These capture loss of control, not loss of profit.

4.1 Cash Flow Volatility Spike

What it measures
“How wild daily net cash swings are.”

Data needed

Daily net cash delta

Why it matters
Volatility increases failure risk nonlinearly.

Yellow

Std dev increasing faster than revenue

Red

Sustained high volatility

Frequent negative days

4.2 Recovery Time Elongation

What it measures
“How long it takes to recover after a bad period.”

Data needed

Time between negative and positive streaks

Why it matters
Healthy businesses recover quickly.

Yellow

Recovery taking longer

Red

No recovery after shocks

5️⃣ CONCENTRATION & DEPENDENCY SIGNALS

These measure fragility, not performance.

5.1 Revenue Source Concentration

What it measures
“How dependent revenue is on one source.”

Data needed

Source attribution (bank, processor, POS)

Why it matters
Single points of failure are deadly.

Yellow

One source >60% of inflows

Red

One source >80% or growing dominance

5.2 Customer / Event Concentration

What it measures
“Are fewer events driving more revenue?”

Data needed

Transaction size distribution

Why it matters
Lumpiness hides risk.

Yellow

Median ticket shrinking, mean stable

Red

Outliers dominating revenue

How this maps to your simulator (important)

Each intervention should map to expected signals.

Example:

Intervention: revenue_drop
Expected signals:

Revenue Velocity Deceleration

Cash Runway Compression

Volatility Spike

Intervention: deposit_delay
Expected signals:

Deposit Delay Drift

Cash Timing Mismatch

Intervention: expense_spike
Expected signals:

Expense Creep

Payroll Load Stress

Cash Runway Compression

This gives you ground truth validation:

“Did our system detect what we know we injected?”

The advisor-facing magic

An advisor never wants:

“Your EBITDA is down 3.2%.”

They want:

“Your payroll is starting to hit before deposits, and your cash buffer is shrinking. If this continues, you’ll feel it in ~45 days.”

Your signal taxonomy enables that exact sentence.
